								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>The UN Biodiversity Lab is an impartial online mapping tool that provides users with access to over 100 high quality global datasets to support conservation reporting and decision-making. In particular, the UN Biodiversity Lab supports stakeholder analysis and reporting on progress towards the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Biodiversity Targets. To support this goal, we provide data on biodiversity, protected area estates, biodiversity threats, and data related to the Sustainable Development Goals. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">I’m not part of an organization or government. Can I still access the data?</a>
									<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  	<p>Yes! The UN Biodiversity Lab is for anyone who is interested in learning more about mapping and sustainable development. Anyone is welcome to create an account and access our global datasets. In addition to a host of open data layers, the platform includes some data layers from third party organisations which may be subject to use restrictions.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">I am a policymaker. How can I access my national project?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>If you are a policymaker who is involved with the Sixth National Report (6NR) to the Convention on Biological Diversity, then a national project has been automatically created for you. You will need to contact the project administrator to request access. You can view our administrator list <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18YZbPrAoaP6xDsWdE6jefUYaxSFmFABTwVrG2hEvI3Y/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="UN Biodiversity Lab Administrators">here</a>.

							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">Is UN Biodiversity Lab open source?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>The UN Biodiversity Lab data is powered by MapX, which is an open-source web mapping platform that creates customized mapping applications for environmental data. <a href="https://github.com/unep-grid/map-x-mgl" target="_blank" title="MapX Github">You can see the source code for MapX here</a>. The data that has been compiled for visualization and dissemination in the UN Biodiversity Lab is often open license, meaning that you are welcome to explore and share anything you find on the website. However, if data providers have placed certain restrictions on their data sets, some of the functionality of UN Biodiversity Lab will be reduced for these specific layers (for example, they some data can  be viewed but not downloaded or republished without permission from the original data provider).</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What is the difference between UN Biodiversity Lab and MapX?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>The UN Biodiversity Lab is a customized application powered by, and built upon, the open-source MapX web mapping platform. The data in the UN Biodiversity Lab has been customized and curated to meet the reporting requirements of the Sixth National Report  for the Convention on Biological Diversity.

						<h2>Data</h2>

						<ul class="accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What data does the UN Biodiversity Lab have?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>The UN Biodiversity Lab highlights biodiversity data, conservation estates, threats to biodiversity, and data related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The biodiversity data includes ecological land use, biodiversity hotspots, key biodiversity areas, species distribution and NASA data. Conservations estates include the World Database on Protected Areas and community conserved areas. Threats to biodiversity include the human footprint, mining, and land use changes. SDG  data includes hydrosheds for 3200 cities, poverty, and land tenures. The biodiversity data curated by the UN Biodiversity Lab focuses on helping countries report against five specific Aichi Biodiversity Targets. These include the following:</p>

									<ul>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 5: Halve or bring to zero rate of loss of habitats, significantly reduce degradation and fragmentation.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 11: Conserve 17% of terrestrial and 10% coastal and marine areas, especially important biodiversity areas, important ecosystem services, through effective, equitable, representative well-connected protected areas and other effective area-based measures and integrated into landscapes and seascapes.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 12: Prevent extinctions and improve and sustain species most in decline.</representative>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 14: Restore and safeguard ecosystems that provide essential services – water, health, livelihoods – especially for women, indigenous peoples, local communities, and poor and vulnerable.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 15: Enhance resilience and contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks and restore 15% of degraded ecosystems</vulnerable.>
									</ul>

									<p>UN Environment, UNDP and WCMC have identified and curated the best available data layers for each of these targets to enable more streamlined analysis and reporting. The list of available data layers may expand in the future.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
							<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">Where does the data come from?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
									<p>The UN Biodiversity Lab acts as an impartial, trustworthy data broker for over 40 premier research institutions, including Alliance for Zero Extinctions, Birdlife, Flanders Marine Institute, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Google Earth Engine, GRID Arendal, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-Modis), the Ramsar Convention, and the US Geological Survey (USGS). The source of each dataset can be found within the metadata. </p>

					<div class="box--white">
						<h2>Tools and Functions</h2>

						<ul class="accordion">
								<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">Can I perform an intersection or overlap between two datasets?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>Yes, all users can perform a visual, temporary intersection between two to five vector layers, one of which must be a polygon, using the highlight button available in the top toolbar and toolbox. Users can also enable an approximate overlap area estimation directly within the MapX platform. Publishers in National Projects can create new views out of overlaps for more accurate reporting and synthesis. For more information on how to perform an intersection analysis, see the <a href="https://www.mapx.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6NR-Technical-Guidance-Spatial-Vol-EN-FINAL-17-Dec-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" title="Offline User Guide">see the offline User Guide</a>. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What is the difference between spatial data and attribute data? </a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
									<p>Usually spatial datasets contain both spatial and attribute data. Spatial data pinpoints where something is located on the planet in an absolute sense. It is generally presented as geographic coordinates or an address. Attribute data is information attached to a specific coordinate that is not directly geospatial, for example the name of the structure or type of object. The UN Biodiversity Lab displays spatial data with one attribute per view. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What is the difference between a view and a layer? </a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
							  	<p>When data is uploaded to the UN Biodiversity Lab, it becomes a source layer, which then needs to be published and visualized as one or more views. Source layers can have many attributes, however views in UN Biodiversity Lab only visualize one attribute at a time. An example of this would be uploading spatial data on water bodies that has attributes for each point describing the type of water body, date of data collection, and source of water. While the source layer has multiple attributes, a view can only visualize one of these attributes on the map, such as type of water body. Views are what are selected and displayed on the map through the view panel, but the metadata information originates from the source layer.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">Is there a limit to the number of views I can display on the map?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
							  	<p>There is no limit to the number of views that can be turned on and displayed on UN Biodiversity Lab simultaneously. However, as you load more views you may find it difficult to see all of them simultaneously and may need to adjust their coloration or transparency. For more details on how to do this, see page 25 of the UN Biodiversity Lab <a href="https://www.mapx.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6NR-Technical-Guidance-Spatial-Vol-EN-FINAL-17-Dec-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" title="Offline User Guide">offline User Guide</a>. </p>

						<h2>Story Maps</h2>

						<ul class="accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What is a story map?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>A story map is a dynamic way to communicate spatial data by  combining a narrative, interactive maps, photos, and videos. Story maps are a simple yet powerful way to inform, engage, and inspire your audience with any story you want to tell that can be referenced on a map. Story maps harness the power of maps by bringing data to life.</p>
									<p>The UN Biodiversity Lab story map engine allows users involved in national projects to independently build story maps without any GIS or programming skills. Story maps can cover a wide variety of subjects and are easy to build.They are fully interactive and users can explore the attributes of the underlying data. To see an example, <a href="https://app.mapx.org?project=MX-XNI-RMZ-KKL-FMS-DVH&views=MX-GOAC8-XYLMA-LQ7YR&storyAutoStart=true" target="_blank" title="UNBL Story Map">click here</a>. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">How can I make a story map?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
									<p>Only users with publisher and administrator rights in national projects can create story maps. To learn more about creating a storyboard for your story map before developing it on the platform, click here.When you have completed the storyboard, view <a href="https://www.mapx.org/knowledge-base/build-story-map/" target="_blank" title="Building Story Maps">this link here</a> for a guidance document on building your own story map.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">How can I share my story map?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
							  	<p>You can click the sharing icon, located in the view toolbar beneath the abstract of the story map, to receive a customized link to embed the story map into your blog, website, or online content through an iFrame, or a link to share the story map through email or social media.</p>

								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What if my data is sensitive?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide"><p>You can keep data in your national project, which is secure and managed by the UNDP and UN Environment web management team. When uploading data, you will need to assign viewing rights to your data. These range from ‘myself’ (only you), to ‘members’ in the project, to ‘administrators’, meaning only the administrator will be able to see the data you have uploaded. These correspond to certain user privilege categories. As an administrator of a project you have complete control over who interacts with data within your national project, which you can upload and control. However you will not be able to publish data publicly beyond your project. For more details see about User Privileges see <a href="user-guide.html#invitemembers" target="_blank" title="Online User Guide">“Invite Members and Define Roles” </a> in the online User Guide. </p>

								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>Maps included in reports should meet several different standards.</p>
									<ul class="bullets">
										<li class="accordion-item">Maps should be sufficiently high resolution (Pixels Per Centimeter/Inch - PPC/PPI) for them to be clearly visible. Maps from UN Biodiversity are exported at ~430 PPI in PDF format and ~72 PPI in PNG format, both of which are acceptable for inclusion in your 6NR. If you use a program such as Powerpoint to redesign the maps, ensure you export your final maps at a high enough resolution.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">Maps should be clear and concise. One way to help focus attention on your country is to change the shadowing effect around countries.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">Important text on maps should be clear and legible (e.g., cities, place names, legend items, etc.).</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">The map should include basic mapping elements: legend (of relevant data layers), scale bar, and directional (North) arrow. </li>
										<li class="accordion-item">Correct attribution for all the data sources used in creating the map. This information can be found in the abstract of the view, by clicking on the information button in the view, or is exported in a JSON format when you download the map.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">The projection of the map. In UN Biodiversity Lab this is WGS 84. </li>
								    <li class="accordion-item">The owner of the data and data access rights. This should include the rights, restrictions and ownership of any national level data from your government that you may be using. </li>

							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion__trigger accordion-opener">What is the data integrity assessment framework?</a>
								<div class="accordion__content slide">
								  <p>All uploaded data undergoes the data integrity assessment framework, at the discretion of the data uploader. The integrity of each data layer is assessed using a standardized set of questions for each of the following four categories: (1) Reliability; (2) Technical Accessibility; (3) Openness; and (4) Sustainability. The level of compliance with each element of the data integrity standards is established in the course of the assessment. The results are contained within a database that is managed by UN Biodiversity Lab, together with data custodians. Following completion of the data integrity assessment, the results of the assessment are shared with the data custodians who are given the opportunity to take remedial actions to improve results prior to publication of the data sets and corresponding data integrity scores. <b>You can access each public view's data integrity assessment score in the metadata.</b> To learn more, access the guidance document <a href="https://www.mapx.org/knowledge-base/the-mapx-data-integrity-framework/" title="Guidance Document about the data integrity assessment framework">here</a>.</p>
