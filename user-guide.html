                  <p>The colour of the button denotes the type of data that created the view: purple for raster data and green for vector data. Vector and raster data are two fundamentally different ways of representing spatial data. Raster data is broadly thought of as data that represents things that exist on a range of values across space, such as a maps of temperature, land cover, population density, or the percent of canopy closure in a forest. The attribute of raster data is a value within a pixel (or grid cell) and can represent categorical values (such as a land cover classification) or continuous values such as elevation. In this example, the Biodiversity Intactness Index is a raster view in which every pixel has a continuous value.</p>
                  <img class="accordion__image" src="images/user-guide/data-catalogue/4.2-What-do-the-button-colours-mean.gif" alt="What do the button colors mean? GIF">
                  <p>Conversely, vector data is data that represents linear or area features on a map, such as highways (lines), cities (points), or species range maps (polygons). Vector data will normally contain not just a feature on a map, but will also have other data associated with it called attribute data. Attributes can be many things, such as place names, the area of a feature, or other calculated or derived data that is associated with a feature. In this example, for each feature in the Ecoregions2017 dataset in UN Biodiversity Lab there is an attribute for that feature’s Ecoregion (a finer scale land classification), as well as its Biome (a more generalised land classification). Try comparing two datasets, one with a purple button and one with a green button.</p>
                  <img class="accordion__image" src="images/user-guide/data-catalogue/4.3-What-do-the-button-colours-mean.png" alt="What do the button colors mean?">
                  <p>In addition, there are red buttons which denote an external geodatabase that is hosted on the UN Biodiversity Lab, such as the World Database on Protected Areas. Geodatabases are secure cloud-based spatial data containers, maintained by research institutions for spatial data that the UN Biodiversity Lab updates regularly. The World Database on Protected Areas is the largest database of legally defined protected areas on the planet. This data is updated every month.</p>

                  <p>Blue buttons denote story maps. Story maps are an innovative storytelling tool which combines spatial data, narrative, and multimedia to communicate complex messages to wide audiences. To play a story map, click the play button. You can also interact with the data in story maps by locking or unlocking the “lock” in the top toolbar at any point in the story map where spatial data is shown.</p>

                  <p>In this example, you can see the two View Toolbars highlighted differ slightly. That is because one is a raster and one is a vector. Vector data has slightly more functions available on the platform. For example, the vector toolbar has the buttons “Zoom to all features” and “Zoom on displayed features”. These two buttons will help you display your selected vector features in the frame.</p>
                  <img class="accordion__image" src="images/user-guide/data-catalogue/6.2-The-view-toolbar.gif" alt="The View Toolbar GIF">
                  <p>The “Settings” button in the View Toolbar can be used to select a range of values to display within the iframe and/or the transparency of the view. Some vector views that include a temporal range of data can be filtered using a time-slider.</p>
                  <p>When you want to reset the settings back to nil, you can click the “reset” button.</p>

This button will return information about the dataset, including the the data provider, which projects the dataset is in, a link to retrieve the homepage of the source.

                  <p>You can download vector data in several different formats for use in your own programs, including ESRI shapefiles, geoJSON, and KML. Currently, the process to download raster data is not as simple.

You cannot download any data if you are not logged in.</p>

                  <p>Once the download has finished, you will receive an email with a link to your data. Please note that, as some are protected under a view-only license, not all views are available for download.

                  <p>UN Biodiversity Lab enables you to save, customize, and download the maps you create on the platform through our map composer tool. The map composer exports all views that are active on map, its legends, abstracts, and titles in PNG format at a user-defined resolution and allows full editing of structure and content of the map. Please note that the map composer is optimized for use in Google Chrome.</p>

                  <p>To download your map in high resolution and certain width and height measures, you can switch the unit of measurement from “px” (pixels) to “mm” (millimeters) or “in” (inches) and define the resolution (in dpi) of the output. Define the size of the area that will be exported by dragging the margins of the “page”. Place the items where you prefer within the page by dragging them from the central point of the box. Resize them by dragging the margins. Text in the text box can also be edited, but please ensure that you include data provider information in the abstract text box. Use the sidebar on the right to change the layout, the size of the text and its appearance within a selected text box. Legends with large amounts of classes can be organized in multiple columns using the “Legend columns” button.</p>

                  <p>UN Biodiversity Lab offers the ability for users to create new maps and spatial datasets by manually drawing vector features (points, lines and polygons) on the map. This could, for example, show proposed protected areas or areas where forest restoration projects are working.</p>

                  Click on the “draw” button located in the top toolbar. Choose whether you would like to draw a polygon, points, or lines on the right of the screen. Please only use one of these shapes at a time as mixed geometries are not yet supported in UN Biodiversity Lab. Create the feature, and finish the polygon or line by double-clicking. If you would like to delete a completed feature, select it by clicking on it once and clicking the “delete” button. When you are done with your drawing, click the “save” button. Saved geometries are converted into a temporary view that appears in your views panel, and can be activated or deactivated like the other views by clicking on it. Please note that the data is not saved in UN Biodiversity Lab and is only visible on your browser.

                  <p>In order to upload your own vector data, it must be compatible with an open source format. This means it must be a ESRI Shapefile, GeoJSON, GPX, or KML file. A GeoJSON format is recommended. If you are unsure, you can see if it is compatible by using an open source software such as QGIS. ESRI Shapefiles must be zipped. Zipped files must include must include the .shp, .shx, .dbf and .prj files. The cartographic reference system must be WGS84.</p>
                  <p>Once you are certain your data is in a compatible format, you can either upload your data by dragging and dropping if the file is less than 100 mb and a GeoJSON, or manual upload if it is between 100 and 300 mb. We strongly suggest using the manual upload, as it is the most stable method of data upload.</p>
